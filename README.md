## About the project

This is a quick tool for Fearless mode to display bans from earlier games for example in stream. Idea is to crop ban columns as browser sources with OBS and use hero icons next to them to control bans.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
